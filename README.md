# A* search algorith
Simple implementation of an [A* searching algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm). Project is completely written in .NET WPF, simple GUI included.

According [this awesome doc](http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/Heuristics.html1) I used Manhattan distance as a heuristic function.
